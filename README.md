The program calDoc.py is the main one. It is using QT Widgets (you need pyqt5 and pyqt-tools to run it) and the file screen (validaDoc.py) created.
The program validaDoc.py is the result of PyQT5 transformation from the screen validaDoc.ui. If you want to change something, you have the original file.
The others files are just beginning copies. You don't need them to solve the calDoc.py. They are transformed according to the goal program.
